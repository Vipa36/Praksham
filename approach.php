            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>For the success of any incentive, it is important that it should be implemented with proper strategical planning. Any large project involves the dedication of its members and help of general public and the government.</p>
            <p>Praksham has strictly followed these principles. We are making extreme efforts indulging the people in our incentive and expanding our volunteer base. More helping hands means ease and rapidness in work.</p>

            <h4>Van Mahotsav</h3>
            <p>India is the land of festivals. We celebrate each and every festival with utmost joy. Similarly, celebrating Van Mahostav also brings enthusiasm among people in planting more and more trees. Instead of annual celebration, we have made this festival monthly. This has increased the pace of our work and a major contributor in plantation of trees</p>

            <h4>Encouraging Farmers</h4>
            <p>The agricultural land have a miniscule contribution in trees population. It is because there is notion among the farmers that if trees are planted across the farming lands, they would suck up all the nutrients making the crops nutrients deprived harming farmers income. We are making efforts in awaring farmers that this notion is wrong and encouraging them to grow trees across the boundaries of their farming lands.</p>
